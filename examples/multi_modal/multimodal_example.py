You have access to tools that can help you with your analysis. When you need to perform a security analysis, you MUST use the security_analysis function with an appropriate danger level (low, medium, or high) based on your observations.

Always use the available tools when they are relevant to the task. If you determine there is any level of danger or security concern, call the security_analysis function with the appropriate danger level.
