Simple Hospital Agent Simulation Demo

A streamlined demo showing medical agents collaborating to treat a headache patient.
This uses the built-in task-based simulation features for easy setup and execution.

Medical Team:
🩺 Dr. Sarah (Emergency Doctor) - Initial assessment and triage
🧠 Dr. Michael (Neurologist) - Headache specialist evaluation
👩‍⚕️ Jennifer (RN) - Patient care coordination
🔬 Dr. Lisa (Radiologist) - Medical imaging interpretation
💊 Robert (PharmD) - Medication management
📋 Dr. Amanda (Coordinator) - Case management

CASE: 34-year-old female with sudden severe headache
