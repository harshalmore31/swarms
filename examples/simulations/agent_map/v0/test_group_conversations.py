Test script for Group Conversation functionality in Agent Map Simulation.

This script demonstrates the new features:
1. Agents can join ongoing conversations
2. Group conversations with multiple participants
3. Enhanced visualization for group discussions
4. Improved status reporting for group interactions

Run this to see agents naturally forming groups and having multi-party conversations!
