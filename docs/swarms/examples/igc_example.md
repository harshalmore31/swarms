## Interactive Groupchat Examples

The Interactive GroupChat is a powerful multi-agent architecture that enables dynamic collaboration between multiple AI agents. This architecture allows agents to communicate with each other, respond to mentions using `@agent_name` syntax, and work together to solve complex tasks through structured conversation flows.

### Architecture Description

The Interactive GroupChat implements a **collaborative swarm architecture** where multiple specialized agents work together in a coordinated manner. Key features include:

- **Mention-based Communication**: Agents can be directed to specific tasks using `@agent_name` syntax
- **Flexible Speaker Functions**: Multiple speaking order strategies (round robin, random, priority-based)
- **Enhanced Collaboration**: Agents build upon each other's responses and avoid redundancy
- **Interactive Sessions**: Support for both automated and interactive conversation modes
- **Context Awareness**: Agents maintain conversation history and context

### Step-by-Step Showcase

* **Agent Creation**: Define specialized agents with unique expertise and system prompts
* **GroupChat Initialization**: Create the InteractiveGroupChat structure with desired speaker function
* **Task Definition**: Formulate tasks using `@agent_name` mentions to direct specific agents
* **Execution**: Run the group chat to generate collaborative responses
* **Response Processing**: Handle the coordinated output from multiple agents
* **Iteration**: Chain multiple tasks for complex workflows

## Installation

Install the swarms package using pip:

```bash
pip install -U swarms
```

## Basic Setup

1. First, set up your environment variables:

```python
WORKSPACE_DIR="agent_workspace"
OPENAI_API_KEY=""
```

## Code

```python

InteractiveGroupChat Speaker Function Examples

This example demonstrates how to use different speaker functions in the InteractiveGroupChat:
- Round Robin: Agents speak in a fixed order, cycling through the list
- Random: Agents speak in random order
- Priority: Agents speak based on priority weights
- Custom: User-defined speaker functions

The example also shows how agents can mention each other using @agent_name syntax.
