# Mixture of Agents Example

The Mixture of Agents (MoA) is a sophisticated multi-agent architecture that implements parallel processing with iterative refinement. This approach processes multiple specialized agents simultaneously, concatenates their outputs, and then performs multiple parallel runs to achieve consensus or enhanced results.

## How It Works

1. **Parallel Processing**: Multiple agents work simultaneously on the same input
2. **Output Concatenation**: Results from all agents are combined into a unified response
3. **Iterative Refinement**: The process repeats for `n` layers/iterations to improve quality
4. **Consensus Building**: Multiple runs help achieve more reliable and comprehensive outputs

This architecture is particularly effective for complex tasks that benefit from diverse perspectives and iterative improvement, such as financial analysis, risk assessment, and multi-faceted problem solving.

## Installation

Install the swarms package using pip:

```bash
pip install -U swarms
```

## Basic Setup

1. First, set up your environment variables:

```python
WORKSPACE_DIR="agent_workspace"
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=""
```

## Code

```python
from swarms import Agent, MixtureOfAgents

    - Value at Risk (VaR)
    - Sharpe ratio
    - Volatility
    - Maximum drawdown
    - Beta coefficient
    
    Provide clear, numerical results with brief explanations.""",
    max_loops=1,

    random_model_enabled=True,
    dynamic_temperature_enabled=True,
    output_type="str-all-except-first",
    max_tokens=4096,
)

# Agent 2: Portfolio Risk Analyzer
portfolio_risk_agent = Agent(
