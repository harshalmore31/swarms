# Board of Directors - Multi-Agent Architecture

The Board of Directors is a sophisticated multi-agent architecture that implements collective decision-making through democratic processes, voting mechanisms, and role-based leadership. This architecture provides an alternative to single-director patterns by enabling collaborative intelligence through structured governance.

## 🏛️ Overview

The Board of Directors architecture follows a democratic workflow pattern:

1. **Task Reception**: User provides a task to the swarm
2. **Board Meeting**: Board of Directors convenes to discuss and create a plan
3. **Voting & Consensus**: Board members vote and reach consensus on task distribution
4. **Order Distribution**: Board distributes orders to specialized worker agents
5. **Execution**: Individual agents execute their assigned tasks
6. **Feedback Loop**: Board evaluates results and issues new orders if needed (up to `max_loops`)
7. **Context Preservation**: All conversation history and context is maintained throughout the process

## 🏗️ Architecture Components

### Core Components

| Component | Description | Purpose |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **BoardOfDirectorsSwarm** | Main orchestration class | Manages the entire board workflow and agent coordination |
| **Board Member Roles** | Role definitions and hierarchy | Defines responsibilities and voting weights for each board member |
| **Decision Making Process** | Voting and consensus mechanisms | Implements democratic decision-making with weighted voting |
| **Workflow Management** | Process orchestration | Manages the complete lifecycle from task reception to final delivery |

## 👥 Board Member Roles

The Board of Directors supports various roles with different responsibilities and voting weights:

| Role | Description | Voting Weight | Responsibilities |
|------|-------------|---------------|------------------|
| `CHAIRMAN` | Primary leader responsible for board meetings and final decisions | 1.5 | Leading meetings, facilitating consensus, making final decisions |
| `VICE_CHAIRMAN` | Secondary leader who supports the chairman | 1.2 | Supporting chairman, coordinating operations |
| `SECRETARY` | Responsible for documentation and meeting minutes | 1.0 | Documenting meetings, maintaining records |
| `TREASURER` | Manages financial aspects and resource allocation | 1.0 | Financial oversight, resource management |
| `EXECUTIVE_DIRECTOR` | Executive-level board member with operational authority | 1.5 | Strategic planning, operational oversight |
| `MEMBER` | General board member with specific expertise | 1.0 | Contributing expertise, participating in decisions |

### Role Hierarchy and Authority

## 🔧 Advanced Features and Customization

### Custom Board Templates

```python
from swarms.config.board_config import get_default_board_template

# Get pre-configured board templates
financial_board = get_default_board_template("financial_analysis")
strategic_board = get_default_board_template("strategic_planning")
tech_board = get_default_board_template("technology_assessment")
crisis_board = get_default_board_template("crisis_management")

# Custom board template
custom_template = {
    "name": "Custom_Board",
    "description": "Custom board for specific use case",
    "board_members": [
        {"role": "CHAIRMAN", "expertise": ["leadership", "strategy"]},
        {"role": "VICE_CHAIRMAN", "expertise": ["operations", "coordination"]},
        {"role": "SECRETARY", "expertise": ["documentation", "communication"]},
        {"role": "TREASURER", "expertise": ["finance", "budgeting"]},
        {"role": "EXECUTIVE_DIRECTOR", "expertise": ["strategy", "operations"]}
    ],
    "agents": [
        {"name": "Research_Agent", "expertise": ["research", "analysis"]},
        {"name": "Technical_Agent", "expertise": ["technical", "implementation"]}
    ],
    "config": {
        "max_loops": 3,
        "decision_threshold": 0.7,
        "enable_voting": True,
        "enable_consensus": True
    }
}
```

### Dynamic Role Assignment

```python
# Automatically assign roles based on task requirements
board_swarm = BoardOfDirectorsSwarm(
    board_members=board_members,
    agents=agents,
    auto_assign_roles=True,
    role_mapping={
        "financial_analysis": ["Treasurer", "Financial_Member"],
        "strategic_planning": ["Chairman", "Executive_Director"],
        "technical_assessment": ["Technical_Member", "Executive_Director"],
        "research_analysis": ["Research_Member", "Secretary"],
        "crisis_management": ["Chairman", "Vice_Chairman", "Communications_Member"]
    }
)
```

### Consensus Optimization

```python
# Advanced consensus-building mechanisms
board_swarm = BoardOfDirectorsSwarm(
    board_members=board_members,
    agents=agents,
    enable_consensus=True,
    consensus_timeout=300,  # 5 minutes timeout
    min_participation_rate=0.8,  # 80% minimum participation
    auto_fallback_to_chairman=True,  # Chairman can make final decisions
    consensus_rounds=3,  # Maximum consensus building rounds
    consensus_method="weighted_majority",  # Consensus method
    enable_mediation=True,  # Enable mediation for conflicts
    mediation_timeout=120  # Mediation timeout in seconds
)
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting and Debugging

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Consensus Failures**
   - **Issue**: Board cannot reach consensus within loop limit
   - **Solution**: Lower voting threshold, increase max_loops, or adjust voting weights
   ```python
   board_swarm = BoardOfDirectorsSwarm(
       decision_threshold=0.6,  # Lower threshold
       max_loops=5,            # More loops
       consensus_timeout=600   # Longer timeout
   )
   ```

2. **Agent Timeout**
   - **Issue**: Individual agents take too long to respond
   - **Solution**: Increase timeout settings or optimize agent prompts
   ```python
   board_swarm = BoardOfDirectorsSwarm(
       timeout_per_agent=600,  # 10 minutes per agent
       enable_agent_pooling=True  # Use agent pooling
   )
   ```

3. **Poor Quality Output**
   - **Issue**: Final output doesn't meet quality standards
   - **Solution**: Enable quality gates, increase max_loops, or improve agent prompts
   ```python
   board_swarm = BoardOfDirectorsSwarm(
       enable_quality_gates=True,
       quality_threshold=0.8,
       enable_peer_review=True,
       max_loops=4
   )
   ```

4. **Resource Exhaustion**
   - **Issue**: System runs out of resources during execution
   - **Solution**: Implement resource limits, use agent pooling, or optimize parallel execution
   ```python
   board_swarm = BoardOfDirectorsSwarm(
       max_workers=2,  # Limit parallel workers
       enable_agent_pooling=True,
       parallel_execution=False  # Disable parallel execution
   )
   ```

### Debugging Techniques

```python
# Debugging configuration
debug_config = BoardConfig(
    max_loops=1,  # Limit loops for debugging
    enable_logging=True,
    log_level="DEBUG",
    enable_tracing=True,
    debug_mode=True
)

# Create debug swarm
debug_swarm = BoardOfDirectorsSwarm(
    agents=agents,
    config=debug_config
)

# Execute with debugging
try:
    result = debug_swarm.run(task)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
    print(f"Debug info: {debug_swarm.get_debug_info()}")

# Enable detailed logging
import logging
logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.DEBUG,
    format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'
)

# Create swarm with logging enabled
logging_swarm = BoardOfDirectorsSwarm(
    agents=agents,
    config=BoardConfig(
        enable_logging=True,
        log_level="DEBUG",
        enable_metrics=True,
        enable_tracing=True
    )
)
```
