## Communication Structure

!!! note "Communication Protocols"
    The [Conversation](conversation.md) documentation details the communication protocols and structures used between agents in these architectures.

## Choosing the Right Architecture

When selecting a multi-agent architecture, consider the following factors:

!!! tip "Task Complexity"
    Simple tasks may only need basic architectures like RoundRobin, while complex tasks might require Hierarchical or Graph-based approaches.

!!! tip "Parallelization Needs"
    If tasks can be executed in parallel, consider ConcurrentWorkflow or MatrixSwarm.

!!! tip "Decision Making Requirements"
    For consensus-based decisions, MajorityVoting is ideal.

!!! tip "Resource Optimization"
    If you need to optimize agent usage, consider SwarmRouter or TaskQueueSwarm.

!!! tip "Learning Requirements"
    If agents need to learn from each other, MALT is the appropriate choice.

!!! tip "Dynamic Adaptation"
    For tasks requiring dynamic adaptation, consider SwarmRearrange or Auto Swarm Builder.
