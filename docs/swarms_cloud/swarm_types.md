# Multi-Agent Architectures

Each multi-agent architecture type is designed for specific use cases and can be combined to create powerful multi-agent systems. Below is an overview of each available swarm type:

| Swarm Type           | Description                                                                  | Learn More |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| AgentRearrange       | Dynamically reorganizes agents to optimize task performance and efficiency. Useful when agent effectiveness depends on their sequence or arrangement. | [Learn More](agent_rearrange.md) |
| MixtureOfAgents      | Builds diverse teams of specialized agents, each contributing unique skills to solve complex problems. Excels at tasks requiring multiple types of expertise. | [Learn More](mixture_of_agents.md) |
| SequentialWorkflow   | Executes tasks in a strict, predefined order. Perfect for workflows where each step depends on the completion of the previous one. | [Learn More](sequential_workflow.md) |
| ConcurrentWorkflow   | Runs independent tasks in parallel, significantly reducing processing time for complex operations. Ideal for tasks that can be processed simultaneously. | [Learn More](concurrent_workflow.md) |
| GroupChat            | Enables dynamic collaboration between agents through a chat-based interface, facilitating real-time information sharing and decision-making. | [Learn More](group_chat.md) |
| HierarchicalSwarm    | Implements a structured, multi-level approach to task management, with clear lines of authority and delegation. | [Learn More](hierarchical_swarm.md) |
| MultiAgentRouter     | Acts as an intelligent task dispatcher, distributing work across agents based on their capabilities and current workload. | [Learn More](multi_agent_router.md) |
| MajorityVoting       | Implements robust decision-making through consensus, ideal for tasks requiring collective intelligence or verification. | [Learn More](majority_voting.md) |


<!-- | AutoSwarmBuilder     | Automatically configures agent architectures based on task requirements and performance metrics, simplifying swarm creation. | [Learn More](auto_swarm_builder.md) |
<!-- | Auto                | Intelligently selects the most effective swarm architecture for a given task based on context. | [Learn More](auto.md) | -->
