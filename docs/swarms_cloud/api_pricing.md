!!! abstract "Overview"
    The Swarm Agent API provides a powerful platform for managing multi-agent collaboration at scale and orchestrating swarms of LLM agents in the cloud. Our pricing model is designed to be transparent and cost-effective, enabling you to harness the full potential of your agents with ease.

## Credit System

The Swarm API operates on a credit-based system with the following characteristics:

- **Credits** are the currency used within the platform

- 1 credit = $1 USD

- Credits can be purchased with USD or $swarms Solana tokens

### Credit Types

| Type | Description | Expiration |
|------|-------------|------------|
| Standard Credits | Purchased credits | Never expires |
| Free Credits | Promotional credits | May have expiration dates |

## Pricing Structure

### Base Costs

| Cost Component | Price |
|----------------|-------|
| Base cost per agent | $0.01 per agent |

### Token Usage Costs

| Token Type | Cost |
|------------|------|
| Input tokens | $2.00 per 1M tokens |
| Output tokens | $4.50 per 1M tokens |

### Night-Time Discount

!!! tip "Off-Peak Hours Discount"
    To encourage efficient resource usage during off-peak hours, we offer significant discounts for operations performed during California night-time hours:

    | Time Period (Pacific Time) | Discount |
    |----------------------------|----------|
    | 8:00 PM to 6:00 AM | 75% off token costs |

## Cost Calculation

### Formula

The total cost for a swarm execution is calculated as follows:

```math
Total Cost = (Number of Agents Ã— $0.01) + 
             (Total Input Tokens / 1M Ã— $2.00 Ã— Number of Agents) +
             (Total Output Tokens / 1M Ã— $4.50 Ã— Number of Agents)
```

With night-time discount applied:
```math
Input Token Cost = Input Token Cost Ã— 0.25
Output Token Cost = Output Token Cost Ã— 0.25
```

### Example Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Basic Workflow (Day-time)

!!! example "Basic Workflow Example"
    **Parameters:**
    
    - 3 agents
    
    - 10,000 input tokens total
    
    - 25,000 output tokens total

    **Calculation:**
    
    - Agent cost: 3 Ã— $0.01 = $0.03
    
    - Input token cost: (10,000 / 1,000,000) Ã— $2.00 Ã— 3 = $0.06
    
    - Output token cost: (25,000 / 1,000,000) Ã— $4.50 Ã— 3 = $0.3375
    
    - **Total cost: $0.4275**

#### Scenario 2: Complex Workflow (Night-time)

!!! example "Complex Workflow Example"
    **Parameters:**
    
    - 5 agents
    
    - 50,000 input tokens total
    
    - 125,000 output tokens total

    **Calculation:**
    
    - Agent cost: 5 Ã— $0.01 = $0.05
    
    - Input token cost: (50,000 / 1,000,000) Ã— $2.00 Ã— 5 Ã— 0.25 = $0.125
    
    - Output token cost: (125,000 / 1,000,000) Ã— $4.50 Ã— 5 Ã— 0.25 = $0.703125
    
    - **Total cost: $0.878125**
